- Improve options.

  - Per-stream options (which require not opening the codecs right away).

  - Current input behaviour:
    - av.open(..., options={}, container_options={}, stream_options=[{}, ...])
    - Those options are provided to each stream via avformat_find_stream_info,
      which is called immediately. However, it isn't garunteed to open all
      codecs, so options may not have been provided at this time.

  - Ideal input behaviour:
    - You can defer the avformat_find_stream_info, and get basic stream info
      before setting options.
    - stream.codec_context.options then gets during avformat_find_stream_info
      or open or whatever.

- AVFormatContext::interrupt_callback

- Container.decode_one(**demux_kwargs) -> Frame
  There would be a Container._buffered_decoded_frames or something that would
  contain extras, just in case.

  - Stream.decode_one() would do the same.

- Data stream support.

- Stream.encode(packet) should also mux frames.
  For b/c, it should return packets with a _muxed_by_encode flag set, which then
  has them get ignored once; the flag is reset when muxed.

- assert reasonable time_base and PTS handling

  AudioFifo

    What does it need?
      A: - sample_fmt
         - channel_layout

    Where does it get them?
      The first frame it processes.



  AudioResampler
    - what does it need?
      - in/out sample_fmt
      - in/out channel_layout
      - in/out sample_rate

- assert nb_channels vs channel_layout

- Make everything mutable. Later, we can introduce a PseudoMutable base class
  for everything that has a .assert_mutable() method and public is_read_only

- Document/test the entire API (in the most casual way).

- Include build discovery info into the module, retrievable by `python -m av --version`

- VideoFrame.from_file(file_or_path); opens the file and decodes the first frame

- InternalObject class for stopping construction:

    __cinit__(self, sentinel):
        assert sentinel
    
    @classmethod
    cdef alloc(cls, ...):
        self = cls(sentinel)
        self._init(*args, **kwargs)
    
- isdeferredinstance loads the module via sys.modules, then getattr on it, and
  finally do an isinstance.
  
  isdeferredinstance(x, ('PIL.Image', 'Image'))

- Rename Buffer and ByteSource to represent they are opposite directions of
  the same operation.

- `atexit.register` something to clean up FFmpeg threads

- Directly use the Numpy C-API
  - see: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/c-api.array.html
  - see: https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/tutorials-numpy#c-api-initalization

- Move the logic regard initializating a VideoReformatter into the object
  itself instead of the VideoFrame.reformat method.

- Protocol for streams to pull packets from iterators. Then secondary streams
  get easier: container.add_stream('audio_codec', source=av.open('music.aiff').iter_packets(only_primary=True))

- Make av.utils.SmartPointer to wrap around a pointer? All this would do is
  hold a reference to said pointer and make sure it isn't garbage collected.

- Look at how stream alloc works; can we manually do this and register the
  stream on a format context later?

- Various AudioLayout/AudioFormat/VideoFormat attributes should be writable.
    - is_mutable flags on various objects (including formats, layouts, contexts,
      streams, etc.) could guard the __set__ methods of properties.

- Should methods be: to_bytes, as_bytes, tobytes, asbytes??

- Plane.array_format could be a format string for array.array
- Plane.update_from_array(array.array)
    - If it were HD RGB then it would be 1920 * 1080 * 3 long.
- Plane.update_from_ndarray(numpy.ndarray)
    - If it were HD RGB then it would have shape (1080, 1920, 3)
- Plane.update(input_)
    And then it tries if it is a buffer, memoryview, bytes, etc..

- TestCase.rms_diff(one, two) -> Root-mean-square diff
- try to wrap API of testsrc filters

- Replicate av_frame_get_best_effort_timestamp
